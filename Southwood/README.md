# Southwood Program

Program designed by Dan John ([read about it here](https://www.t-nation.com/training/lessons-from-southwood)).

The basic design of this program uses the same weight for every set. In fact, it's designed to use the same weight for all movements, though this can be changed, especially for the shoulder press.
